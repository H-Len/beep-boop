# _beep-boop_

#### _Takes a number from the user and returns all numbers from 0 to inputted # with some exceptions, which will return a string in place of the number, 04/05/19_

#### By _**Hannah Melendy**_

## Description

_takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 0 to the user inputted number._
_* Numbers that contain a 1: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Beep!"
* Numbers that contain a 2: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Boop!"
* Numbers that contain a 3: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."_
_The rules in this list are in reverse order of importance: numbers containing a 3 take priority over those containing a 2, and so on._
_For example, 23 would be substituted with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."

_Spec: The program returns a range of numbers from 0 to the users inputted number
